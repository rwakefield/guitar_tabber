### Congratulations, you found this!

What you are looking at is a small application to show off a few of my skills which are:

* Ruby on Rails
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Github

As the description states this application is a quick and easy guitar tab creator.

It allows you to manually create a guitar tab by clicking on notes, locking notes to enter a chord, and entering pre-loaded chords from the database.

You can see the app in action here:

**Note: I am still very much working on this application so donâ€™t judge too hard (you can track the issues to see where it is going)**

#### Before I forget
